Password Manager (Java)

This is my small project made in Java.
I created it to practice programming.

What it does
When the program starts, it asks for a master password (now it is just 1234 inside the code).

If the password is correct, you enter the main menu:
1 - Add → add new site, login and password
2 - Show → show saved passwords
3 - Exit → save and quit

The program saves everything in a text file called passwords.txt.
When you start the program again, it loads the saved data.
